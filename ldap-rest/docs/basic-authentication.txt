The rest service is published under basic authentication.

When deploying the service on a new application server make sure to define the "rest-client" role and assign a user to it.


TOMCAT EXAMPLE:

- add to tomcat-users.xml file:

<role rolename="rest-client"/>
<user username="test" password="test" roles="rest-client"/>
